Since the beginning of this year I have the pleasure to work with one of the new MacBook Pro (yes, the one with the new touch bar).
Coming from an all-set-up system running ArchLinux I aimed to set up everything to get me up to speed in my daily development process 
while keeping everything under control.

For this reason, I intended to install and manage as much as I can through Homebrew.

## Installing Brew

```terminal
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install Brew Cask
```terminal
brew tap caskroom/cask
```

Install Brew Casks Versions
```terminal
brew tap caskroom/versions
```
