title: Devlog - A Diary (not only) for your GSOC project

I have been quiet for some time (part of the reason is that I was able to attend
  [ScalaDays Copenhagen]), and I realize that this post comes just a
little late for the start of the coding period of [GSOC]. However, I hope these
tips will still be helpful to you for maintaining a development diary in form
of a simple blog you can show off at the end of the summer.

I just released a [DevlogTemplate]{:.github-link} to simplify the setup. It's not a
huge deal, but it may help to focus on the main goal of your summer project
while still having a platform to keep track of your progress.
There are plenty of tutorials out there on how to set up a [Jekyll]-based blog
for [Github Pages][Jekyll as static site generator for Github Pages], so this is not going to be a [technical tutorial][static website with Jekyll and Gitub Pages].

What is this all about if not a set of instructions on how to run your dev
diary, you may ask. In the core, I want to point out a few ways _how to
structure_ the content of your blog, _what to present_, and _why you should do
it_. We at [MovingBlocks] do not prescribe our students to use the template (or
any particular form of documentation) but rely on agreements between students
and mentors. However, we hope that some participants will pick it up.

## Why should you consider keeping a Dev Diary?

First of all, **it is fun** to see what you achieved over the last days, weeks,
months. It can keep you motivated even if the visual outcome is very small at
times. Remember all the bugs you reported and investigated? All the small PRs
that led towards a bigger goal? In your dev diary, you can see all these small
steps you took!

In addition, your Dev Diary functions as a **comprehension of your project**
(or at least will help you wrapping everything up in the end). Spending little
time (nearly) every day prevents you from writing time-consuming recaps and
summaries each week (or last minute after several months).

Probably not the most important aspect is that you can share your progress with
others, e.g., make it available to members of the community your are
collaborating to. A dev diary is just another form of documentation, co-existing
with project boards (like [Github Projects]), detailed blogs (see  [Nihal's
blog][Nihal]), or forum posts/threads. If you are not actively documenting your
work, you should consider getting started with this little gem.

## What is going to be presented there?

At a bare minimum your **pull requests**, **issues** you reported or
investigated, and pieces of **documentation and reference** you found of
interest  should be collected. You may want to add a few words on the context
and what is contained in your activity. Having a bullet point list of each weak
(or entry) is sufficient, and you can improve your diary from that point
forward.

_[Karan's devlog] categorized by dates. Each section covers about one week, the
longer bonding period is briefly summed up in the first group._

Your posts can be enhanced it with screenshots or videos, class or architecture diagrams you've sketched, or technical details you want to point out. What was
puzzling to get right? What did you learn while working on a problem? Is there
anything valuable to others? Were you able to apply something you just learned
somewhere else? I bet you can come up with even more ideas.

## How should it be structured?

This depends a bit on how you are planning to use your dev diary. If it is just
for you personally, you can do whatever you want.

Last year's GSOC students  seemed to stick to a **weekly report** style, where
entries were grouped by coding  week or some period of time. Each week, the
student wrote one or multiple posts about the latest progress. These entries can
then be discussed in the next meeting with mentors - just a like an agenda you
set up.

Another approach is to structure single entries by **coding period** or **working phase**. For a Google Summer of Code project you would start with the bonding period, followed by the coding period(s) leading towards the evaluation(s). If
you are working in an agile team using Scrum you could track your personal
contributions per sprint in your diary.

I can only encourage you to get started with your personal devlog for your Google Summer of Code project (or any other project). I hope you found these tips helpful,
and, as always, I appreciate any feedback - you can reach me via
